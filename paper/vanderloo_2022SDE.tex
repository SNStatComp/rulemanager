\section{User stories}  \label{sc:A}

As a statistician producing official statistics, I want to
\begin{enumerate}[S1]
\item Create, Update, and Delete rules so I can fix my current understanding
   of a statistical domain in the form of a formal ruleset.\label{crud}
\item Select a set of rules so I can apply them to my data.
\item Determine the order of rule execution so I have full control over
   data processing and validation.
\item Be able to trace the evolution of my rules and rule sets so I can (a) give full account
   of my production runs, and (b) reproduce production runs.
\item Temporarily remove a rule from one or more rule sets so I can handle exceptional and transient
   data circumstances. This temporary removal should be documented.
\item Temporarily update a rule from one or more rulesets so I can handle exceptional and transient
   data circumstances. This temoporary update should be documented.
\end{enumerate}

As a statistical organization, I want to
\begin{enumerate}[O1]
\item Promote reuse of rules.
\item Promote transparency and learning accross production systems, by
      comparing and benchmarking rules and rule sets.
\end{enumerate}




\section{Formal considerations}
\paragraph The most important thing to do in developing any software system is
to design the formal concepts and relations that are necessary to support its
function. Only then can one guarantee that the resulting system can be fully
understood in the sense that all its capabilities and limitations are known;
that one can reason about its behaviour because it derives from a compact set
of formal concepts and relations; that it is extensible because one can build
complex functionality based on the simple underlying concepts and relations.

\paragraph In the current work, we informally work with data tranformation
rules of various types, and data validation rules and certain tables to store
and manage them. In the following subsections we provide formal definitions for
generic data transformation rules, for the data structures to hold them, and
for the basic operations to manipulate them.



\subsection{What are rules?}
\paragraph The premise of many modern official statistical production systems
is that they should be rule-driven. Yet, a formal definitioin of such data
processing rules seems to be lacking.  Here, we generalize the work on data
validation rules first discussed in \citet{loo2015formal} but see
\cite{loo2018statistical, loo2021datavalidation} for extensive discussions.  In
this work, a data set is a finite collection of data points where a \emph{data
point} is defined as a key-value pair $(k,x)$, where $x$ is the value from a
specified domain $D$ and $k$ is a key that fully identifies the value. To fully
identify a value, it was demonstrated that each key should at least represent
the population, the measurement or observation used to obtain the value, the
unit of the population that was measured, and the variable that was measured.

\paragraph To understand the ful generality of this definition of a data point,
it helps to see an example. Suppose we ask two questions to two employees,
Alice and Bob, of Statistics Netherlands (SN), namely their Age and in what
Division they work: Economic Statistics (ES) or Social Statistics (SS). In this
case there are four data points, identified by the following keys:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
Population      & measurement   & unit & variable \\
\hline
Employees of SN & Our questionnaire & Alice & Age     \\
Employees of SN & Our questionnaire & Alice & Division  \\
Employees of SN & Our questionnaire & Bob & Age \\
Employees of SN & Our questionnaire & Bob & Division  \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
We are quite permissive in our questionnaire, and it is possible that for
example Bob mixes up the answers to the questions by filling in the Age in the
`Division' field, and the Division in the `Age' field. Therefore, the domain $D$
is the union of all possible answers to all possible questions.
$$
D = \{\textrm{SS},\textrm{ES}\}\cup \mathbb{N}\cup\{\textrm{NA}\},
$$
where $\textrm{NA}$ stands for Not Available, to allow for missing values.

\paragraph A \emph{data set} is a collection of data points where each key
occurs exactly once. This gives a data set the structure of a function (a fact
that was also noted by \citet{gelsema2012organisation}) $K\to D$, where $K$ is
a finite set of keys. Observe that we do not force any structure on the data
set. It may consist of a single data point, a record, a few records, or a
collection of random variables from random units from random populations. A
data set is therefore not necessarily relational (as in relational databases)
although in practice they often are. Given a finite set of keys $K$, and a
domain $D$, the set of all possible datasets is the space of functions from $K$
to $D$, denoted $D^K$. We are now ready to define the concept of a rule.

\paragraph A \emph{data transformation rule} $r$ is a function that transforms
one data set into another data set. 
$$
r: D^K\to D'^{K'}.
$$
Here, $D$ and $D'$ may or may not be the same, and similarly $K$ and $K'$ may
or may not be the same.


\subsection{Data structures}
\paragraph Conceptually we work with two data structures: a rule repository and
a rule sequence. We next define basic operations that enable us to represent
the above user stories. 

\paragraph A \emph{rule repository} $R=\{r_1,\ldots,r_m\}$ is a finite set of
rules.  The contents of a rule repository may be time-dependent as new rules
can be added and obsolete rules can be removed. The purpose of a rule
repository is to offer a rich set of rules from which selections can be made
depending on the purpose. For example, data processing rules may differ between
running a flash estimate and an updated estimate, although strong overlap is
likely to exist.

\paragraph A \emph{rule sequence} $L = (r_1,\ldots,r_n)$ is a finite ordered
sequence of rules, where rules come from a predefined, unordered repository.
Rule sequences are applied to data in order, so by function composition we may
also think of $L(t)$ as a data transformation function defined by the
composition $r_n\circ\cdots\circ r_1$. Creating a rule sequence consists of
selecting a subset from a rule repository and placing them in a certain order.
The number of ways this can be done grows quickly with the number of rules.
Even if we assume that each rule may only appear once in a rule sequence, for a
repository of cardinality $m$, there are principally $\sum_{k=0}^m {m\choose
k}!$ such lists. For the current discussion we will not make the
assumption that rules are unique: in the case of data transformation
rules, there may be a certain need for iteration.

In practice we expect that rule sequences will have significant permutational
symmetry, in the sense that rule order can be (partially) changed in many cases
without affecting the action of the sequence on data sets. The trivial case is
two consequtive rules in the rule sequence that pertain to different variables.
These can be swapped without any consequences regarding the outcome.

\paragraph From the user point of view, a rule sequence is the main conceptual
structure to work with. Each production run is controlled by one or more of
such lists, that may be updated as data circumstances evolve over time. From
the organizational point of view, the rule repository is more interesting. The
repository $R(t)$ offers the possibility to avoid duplicates and to discover
common patterns accross rules and rule evolution. In the case of transformation
rules, it offers the possibility to see whether different choices are made in
similar data circumstances; in the case of data validation rules it offers the
possibility to see whether different quality restrictions are defined for the
same variable. The collection of rule sequences derived from the rule
repository are also interesting from the point of view of the organisation as
it allows for benchmarking and comparing production systems.

\paragraph The basic operations on rule repositories are addition and removal
of a single rule. These can be represented as set union $\cup$ and set
difference $-$. For example, if $R=\{r_1,r_2,r_3\}$ then $R\cup
\{r_4\}=\{r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4\}$ and $R-\{r_2\}=\{r_1,r_3\}$.

\paragraph The basic operations on rule sequences are addition or removal of a
single rule at the end of the list. The first operation (concatenation,
$\oplus$) adds an element from a rule repository at the end of a list. We
denote it here as a labeled unary operator:
$$
\oplus_{r}(r_1,\ldots,r_n) = (r_1,\ldots,r_n,r),\: r\in R.
$$
Deletion $\ominus$ is a unary operator that removes the last element of a list.
An empty list is left intact. In notation:
$$
\ominus (r_1,\ldots,r_{n-1},r_n) = (r_1,\ldots,r_{n-1}),\textrm{ and } \ominus()=().
$$
Together these operations allow for inserting any rule into any position.  For
example, to insert a rule after location $i$, first delete alle elements
$n,n-1,\ldots, n-i+1$, concatenate the new rule, and re-concatenate all rules
previously removed. Similarly,  it is possible to delete a rule from any
position. By extension, one can permute rules using sequences of removals and
concatenations.


For example, in order to remove the jth element from a rule
sequence, we just permute with consequtive neighbours until it is the last
element and apply the $\ominus$ operator. Conversely, we can insert a rule at
any position by concatenating it at the end with $\oplus$ and then use a
sequence of permutations to move it into the desired position.

%A permutation $\sigma_{ij}$ swaps the position of the ith and jth element: 
%$$
%\sigma_{ij}(r_1,\ldots, r_i,\ldots,r_j,\ldots, r_n)=
%            (r_1,\ldots, r_j,\ldots,r_i,\ldots, r_n).
%$$
